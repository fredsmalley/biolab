PGP info
========

This program is to extract specified information from HTML files which are dowloaded from 
Personal Genome Project (http://www.personalgenomes.org).

Our goal is to collect and transfer all semi-structured data in PGP to easy-to-read text file so that the data can be exploited by R and other programs.

Tools
-----

* -std=c++11
* GNU Bash 3.2.57
* Python 2.7.6 
* XPath/ElementTree

Files
-----

* README.md
  - It is this file

* tools
  - PGP-main.sh : get participant profiles from PGP website and drive parse/collect
  - parse.py : parse xml/html file and write specific information to file
  - collect.py : collect and merge information into output file

* doc
  - pdfs

* in
  - files to program input including:
  - participants.tsv : file containing participants unique identifications
  - state : states names of USA and its abbreviations
  - DiseaseSurvey : files of diseases survey downloaded from PGP site
  - PGP-participants : participants's profile

* out
  - all kinds of output file generated by program:

* bin
  - executable program

* test
  - test cases
  - PGP-participants : this folder store the downloaded files from PGP

* src
  - search.cpp/.h : regular expression to search particular information
  - util.cpp/.h : functions used to read/write/transform files
  - test.cpp : main function to drive the program

Design
------
* Regular expression is powerful but tedious
* R is powerful but overkill
* Bash & Python are combined to make job easy

TODO
----
* remove quotes from the diseases
* extract key words from diseases string
* sort the diseases by frequency
* separate disease by comma
